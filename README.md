**CONFOR** - tools for knowledge discovery, classification, diagnostics and prediction.

The CONFOR system supports the most effective methods of intelligent data analysis.

The **main functions** of CONFOR are:
- revealing the regularities that characterize classes of objects which are represented as sets of attribute values;
- using the revealed regularities for classification, diagnostics and prediction.

Original methods of knowledge discovery based on the pyramidal networks are taken as a principle in the CONFOR system. A successful long-term application of the methods in different fields of research and development has confirmed their decisive advantages as compared to other known methods.

Chemists have done over a thousand of high-precise prognoses for new chemical compounds and materials. CONFOR is used for analysis of information technologies market. Application field for CONFOR is also medicine, economy, ecology, geology, technical diagnostics, sociology, etc.

Pyramidal networks considerably decrease volumes of search operations that makes it possible to avoid the effect of "information explosion" when solving analytical problems on the basis of large-scale data.

The system forms logical models of object classes which allow to take into account influence on diagnosed or prognosed parameter of separate attributes and their various combinations as well. Besides, it is taken into account influence of "exclusive" attributes, that is such attributes which are incompatible with diagnosed or prognosed value. These properties of models of object classes favour increasing diagnosis and prognosis accuracy.

CONFOR is able to discover a regularity however complex it be.
